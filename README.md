# EE Graphics
This repository contains generic drawings related to Electrical/Computer Engineering, from things like a common-emitter amplifer to an I2C bus drawing.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to hopefully increase the quality of lectures' presentations, quizes and exams by having pre-made (and soon user-generated) nice looking graphics free to use. It's mostly meant to be used in academia (altough I won't stop you from using it for any other purpose).

It comes from my slight frustation of bad-looking drawings used in lectures and exams. I do not blame the professors, as they sometimes are crunched on time and just snip-and-paste the first graphic result from the internet, and don't change it for future classes. Also add on top of that some don't know how to make said graphics, and it would too much time for them to do so. So this repo is meant to serve as a central location for (hopefully) high quality graphics that are pleasing to the eye.

## Licence
For now there is no license (as there is nothing in this repo for now), but I'm thinking once I upload stuff I use a permasive license in usage. I'll think of something.

## Method of Creation
For the most part, 2 methods will be used to generate the graphics: Thru Inkscape or LaTeX with TikZ. The latter will probably be more common in this repo than the former.

## User Generated ??
Initially I'll probably only have graphics that are one-time generated (like a generic I2C timing diagram or other generic drawings), but I'm hoping I could expand to add a command-line utility to generate custom graphics (so for example generate custom signals for an SPI timing diagram).
