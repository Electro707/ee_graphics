### Component Collection.svg

This file contains a bunch of drawings for electronic components in their real-life visual (not symbols). There are large drawings, smaller drawings, and colors for consistancy. The grid is in 1/8in increments. The default units (for everything, including widths) is inches (freedom units).

There are used for soldering kit instructions that I make, as there is no need to create the drawings for each kit and consistancy between them is nice.
