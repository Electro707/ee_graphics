## Component Collection.svg

This file contains a bunch of drawings for electronic components in their real-life visual (not symbols). There are large drawings, smaller drawings, and colors. The grid is in 1/8in increments. The default units (for everything, including widths) is inches (freedom units of course). This file is meant to be copied from and not used directly.

There are used for soldering kit instructions that I make, as there is no need to create the drawings for each kit and consistancy between them is nice.
